1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,639
So if you're looking out for a structured DS algorithm course, I must say you're on the correct channel.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:12,279
So in this video I'll be telling you how the learn DS algorithm from A to Z in depth. Yes.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,679
So first of all, where to learn not on the YouTube channel because it is not structured.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,260
You'll have to head over to the website, take you forward.org might be seeing it on the screen.

5
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:28,120
The UI might be different. Someone's down the line, but doesn't matter.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,659
Which course is it? Something as A to Z DSA course. Open it up.

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:43,899
And as 4 55 modules, covering 18 or 19 topics. Every topic has sub modules like sub parts as well.

8
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,740
So there are a bunch of problems that you will be solving in this particular course.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,240
Is it paid? No, it is absolutely free. And it covers a lot more problems than what the

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,759
course is. Well, you can buy any of the paid courses and you can have a comparison done as well.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,420
So the next question, how do you get the best output of this particular course?

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,599
First of all, the course has like every topic has some theory and every topic has some problems.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,579
Rather a lot of problems. For the theory part, what I will say is watch out the videos.

14
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:28,000
Just watch out the videos and do not dive the just more the topic and then start solving problems.

15
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,879
Because in DSA I'll go, a theory is not that important. Solving problems is important because

16
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:39,739
that will help you to develop the problem solving ability. Got it. So watch out the videos.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,319
Do not dive much and then start solving problems. Stempice. Pick up a problem according to the

18
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,319
problem. Now when I'm saying, try out that problem means if you have a extreme naive solution,

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,000
extreme brute solution hit it convert your thought process into the code right it and some method

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,900
doesn't work doesn't matter. It de blocks there are blocks attached to every problem and solutions are

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,419
categorized if a problem has multiple solution you'll find categorized. So you can read out all of them.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,400
If you're not able to understand, watch out the videos and for every problem that you're not

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,120
able to understand or there is something new. Create nodes so that you can revise afterwards.

24
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,800
Right? And then again, re-try whatever solution you have learned. Retry without watching the video

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,759
without watching the block. Retry. This should be your method of learning. Got it. And this is how you

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,120
can get the best output. But in order to get a accelerated output, what I will recommend you is

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,340
to get a mentor from pre-placed. A pre-placed is a website which offers amazing mentors.

28
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:54,360
The mentors who are working at fan companies or in-depth talk product based companies. So if you get

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,120
a mentor, what will happen is they will have a personalized roadmap. Along with DSS system design,

30
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,360
low level design, whatever you require, they'll give you a personalized roadmap and they'll have

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,159
it online check. One week for arrays. After one week, hey did you complete arrays? Let's have a

32
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,900
lot of resources on system design. Low level design, DSL go and other things project ideas. Since

33
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,219
this people work in industry, they know how everything works. So they'll be giving you project ideas as

34
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,439
well. After that, once you're prepared, you will be able to have mock interviews with them before

35
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,159
the real interview. Resume reviews. According to the jobs that you are applying, you can ask them to

36
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,060
review your resumes. You can have refills from them as well and from their friends as well. And right

37
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,300
the end, you can have a personalized discount code from them. So if you are liking a mentor,

38
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,039
ask them for a discount coupon code. They will be giving you if they do not, you can use

39
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,740
Striva 1000 for an extra 1000 threads. So anyway, we got the link in the description. You can

40
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,800
book a free trial session with any of the mentor. It's absolutely free. Go and check it out.

41
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:07,520
So let's head over to the next part. Covered to right scam. So there is a lot of misinformation in the market

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,860
because it's not paid. It's actually taking a lot of businesses. As I said, we have 90

43
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,300
lakh visits on this course in the last 1.5 years. So first of all, the first thing that everyone

44
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:26,699
is saying is this course is in C++. Absolute garbage absolute nonsense. So I have one video

45
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:33,879
the initial video that that says C++ in one shot. That's it. That's it. Haven't made the video

46
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,600
in one shot. But apart from this video, you pick up any topic. I'm throwing an open challenge.

47
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,240
Pick up any topic. Arase, trees, DP, grass, any of the topics. We'll find that I write

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,759
pseudo code. I don't write code in C++. And in my blogs, we are attaching blogs,

49
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:58,040
notes to every problem. We'll find C++ Java Python JavaScript codes. So we are not teaching C++.

50
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,120
The entire course is in pseudo code. You're focusing on problem solving. Right?

51
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,699
As a second thing is it's not beginner friendly. This is something which everyone

52
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:18,600
like the influence is spreading to because it's a free course. So what I'll ask you to do is

53
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,740
and not say anything. Each of the many of you seniors who are who got recently placed.

54
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,759
As them, here's this guy's driver. Should we follow him? Should we follow the

55
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,339
rivals? He to set the AC course. You can find reviews on building. You can find reviews on Twitter,

56
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,959
and in any way you wish to. Post it to people will tell you the reviews of this course. Do not

57
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:43,720
ask an influencer or anyone who is running a business around this one. Got it? It is absolutely

58
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,500
big enough. And that is why it has 450 5 modules. But I start from easy, then go to medium. And

59
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,740
then I cover a lot of advanced problems with a lot of paid courses in the market of a lot of

60
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,360
basic, easy, in depth. And when it comes to medium and hard, they tend to skip. You can pick up any

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,339
of the free DSC courses. They will end up at 170, 180, 200 at max. And they'll be skipping the

62
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:14,399
advanced problems or they'll be doing three or four of them. But over here, now, of course,

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:26,720
we do a bunch of advanced problems. So it has stuff, but in order to exceed, you need to do

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:35,120
any, frankly, the course has around 250 to 300 concepts or problems for every concept at multiple

65
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,779
problems. So if you are understanding a concept, it might have a four, four, four problems.

66
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,319
So you can solve two and you can skip the rest two. That is your wish. It's not necessarily

67
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:51,120
to solve 455. I've given them per practice for your betterment. Got it. The next thing.

68
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,800
Along with the course, what else should you do? One thing is an absolute must,

69
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,339
quantities. Head over to read code. So basically, need code. There's a website as read code,

70
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,759
head over to court forces. Give every point this. So there is something in the market that,

71
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,779
like a lot of bigness thing that I should learn everything. And then I should start appearing for

72
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:18,819
contest. Do not do that. You know, basic programming, start appearing on the contest.

73
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:23,939
Even if you're able to solve one problem, that is absolutely fine. Give every contest for the next

74
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,360
two years. Give every contest along with learning DS algorithm. To be able to learn,

75
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:35,040
you'll come back and say me, you wear correct, giving contest actually helped me to learn, because

76
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,240
it's a lot of new concepts, a lot of new unseen problems. So you'll learn a lot, lot more, got it.

77
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,680
So to be leaving out the link of this particular A2 set, DSC course, in the description, I'll

78
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,920
leaving out the link of pre-placed. You can book free trial with any of the mentors you wish to

79
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,199
and get onboarded with them. If you haven't fallen beyond, social media, I'll be leaving out all the

80
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,959
social media handles in the description as well. With this, I'll be wrapping up this video. Make sure

81
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,000
to follow the website, not the YouTube channel. With this, I'll be wrapping up this video. Let's
