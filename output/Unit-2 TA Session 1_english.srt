1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,339
the tripp by NB file and you are free to collaborate with your classmates but just try the

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,359
name of the people you collaborate with at the top of the worksheet. I just introduced the

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,420
worksheets to you guys. Workheets to ways on simple linear regression and down multiple linear

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,980
regression will have to just plot a scatter plot and build a linear regression model.

5
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:27,199
Why you have to check if it follows the OS assumptions and validate the linear regression model.

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:34,000
Then the multiple linear regression have to plot a corollogram and check which contributes

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
most to the target variable and build a multiple linear regression model based on that.

8
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:45,380
Workheets will be based on a rich regression, last so and elastic regression you have to build

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,780
all these three models. Workheets both these are logistic regression, you have to just build a logistic

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,179
regression model and the ROC curve and new machine value. So the last data summit will be

11
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:05,159
28 September. Before constructing the corollogram you can use anything label encoding or

12
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,980
one more 10 code. This can ask your doubts in the chat or you can raise your hand will unmute.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,900
You will be another 28 session or four five days before that it lines. So by then your portion

14
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,000
should be covered so you will be able to solve and ask more questions that time. If you have any doubts

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,579
you can written the chat or unmute or raise your hand will unmute.

16
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,319
Can just use the libraries to build the model. Like for linear regression model you can use LM

17
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:39,439
for worksheet to be you can use GLM net. You need not build one from scan just import the

18
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,760
library. You can use any library you want. There is no compression on the syntax you can use any

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,540
syntax or any libraries. Which question the OS assumptions? For all the assumptions you can

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,159
do like three. You can check if the residuals are residuals for the normal distribution.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,019
Can check for homosadacity and you can check for the linear relationship. You can do three.

22
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,659
That's an other answer your question. If you did as a mark down it will be better and professional.

23
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:18,599
If you answer in terms of if it's four then use the code. Both graphs and write ups

24
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,860
because try to add your analysis as much as possible not only code so add comments or

25
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,439
mark down whatever you are plotting. Ignate you can unmute and ask the question.

26
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:36,979
Okay.

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,560
So that's what I answer. You can add a mark down sale and answer in that cell after each

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
question.

29
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,719
Yes.

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,139
Yeah I do and the histogram of residuals is in a phenomenal distribution. But do add like

31
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:03,479
or text else you just don't add the code. Just don't write the code for the plotting

32
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:09,400
histogram and you will add analysis of the graph. Mark down code just add mark down sales.

33
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:15,039
Whenever you want to write the text or analysis then code sales when you want to execute the code.

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,020
There are any more questions or shall end them. There'll be another session

35
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,360
of the day before the deadline. So the portion should be covered by the

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,099
so you guys should be able to solve that. About the hackathon will let you know.

37
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,460
You guys have any more questions. Okay. That will end them. Thank you for joining.

38
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:38,340
If any of you missed the first part of this session you'll make the recording available.

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,379
You guys can catch up with that. Thank you.
