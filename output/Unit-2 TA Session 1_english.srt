1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,599
the trippy by Indefice and you are free to collaborate with your classmates but just try the

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,480
name of the people you collaborated with at the top of the worksheet. So, as is introduced

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,640
the worksheet still by the worksheet two ways on simple linear regression and down multiple

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,920
linear regression. You will have to just plot a scatter plot and build a linear regression model

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,600
which have to check if it follows the OS assumptions and validate the linear regression model.

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:40,280
Then the multiple linear regression have to plot a corralogram and check which contribute

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,719
most to the target variable and build a multiple linear regression model based on that.

8
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:54,280
Worksheep 2B is based on rich regression, last so and elastic regression. You have to

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,200
build all these three models. So, she took me around logistic regression. You have to just build

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,260
all logistic regression model and you are the ROC curve and you are the C value. So,

11
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:15,239
the last date of summer will be 28 September. Before constructing the corralogram you can use

12
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,359
anything label and coding or one more 10 code. This can ask

13
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,560
your doubts in the chat or you can raise your hand will unmute you.

14
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:35,159
There will be another creation four five days before that it lines. So, by then your portion should

15
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,939
be covered. So, you will be able to solve and ask more questions that time. But if you have any doubts

16
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,819
you can put it in the chat or unmute or raise your hand will unmute.

17
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,519
It can just use the libraries to build the model. Like for linear regression model you can use LM

18
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:03,319
and for worksheet 2B you can use GLM net. You need not build one from scouts just import the

19
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,580
life duties. You can use any library you want. There is no compression on the syntax you can use

20
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:22,319
any libraries. Which question the OLS assumptions? For OLS assumptions you can do like 3. You can check

21
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,080
if the residuals are residuals for the normal distribution. You can check with homoced acidity

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,840
and you can check for the linear relationship. You can do 3 that is enough.

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,319
Let us answer your question. If you did as a map down it will be better and professional. If it is

24
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:54,379
code then use the code. Both graphs and write ups because try to add your analysis as much as possible

25
00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:02,439
not only code so add comments or map down for whatever you are plotting. Ignase you can unmute

26
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:24,439
and ask the question. Yes. Inverse you can add a map down cell and answer in that cell after each

27
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:40,080
question. The histogram of residuals is in a polynomial distribution. But do add like a text

28
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:50,560
or code that you want to write the code for plotting histogram and do it. Do add analysis of

29
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,060
the graph. If you add a map down code just add map down cell whenever you want to write the

30
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,879
text or analysis and code cells when you want to execute the code. Add there are any more questions

31
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,259
but Michelin Dhamme, there'll be another T.S. session,

32
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,159
our profile days before the deadline.

33
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,259
So you guys should, the portion should be covered by then.

34
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,740
So you guys should be able to solve that.

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,680
About the hackathon we'll let you know.

36
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,540
So do you guys have any more questions?

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,579
Okay, that will end the meet.

38
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,139
Thank you for joining us.

39
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,740
If any of you have missed the first part of this session,

40
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,519
we'll make the recording available.

41
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,379
You guys can catch up with that.

42
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:33,959
Thank you.
