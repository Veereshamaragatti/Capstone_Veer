1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,599
the trippy by NB files and you are free to collaborate with your classmates but just try the

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,480
name of the people you collaborated with at the top of the worksheet. So, as is introduced

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,620
the worksheet still by the worksheet two ways on simple linear regression and down multiple

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:24,940
linear regression. You will have to just plot a scatter plot and build a linear regression model

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,600
which have to check if it follows the OS assumptions and validate the linear regression model.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,280
Then the multiple linear regression have to plot a corralogram and check which contribute

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,659
most to the target variable and build a multiple linear regression model based on that.

8
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:54,320
Worksheep 2B is based on rich regression, last so and elastic regression. You have to

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,200
build all these three models. Worksheep 2B is on logistic regression. You have to just build

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,760
logistic regression model and you are the ROC curve and a ROC value. So, the last data summit will be

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,719
28 September. Before constructing the core core logogram you can use anything label and coding

12
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:24,599
one more thing. This can ask your doubts in the chat or you can raise your hand will unmute you.

13
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:33,120
There will be another creation four or five days before that it lines. So, by then your

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,060
portion should be covered. So, you will be able to solve and ask more questions at time.

15
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,700
But if you have any doubts you can put it in the chat or unmute or raise your hand will unmute.

16
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,400
You can just use the libraries to build the model. Like for linear regression model you can use

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:02,019
LM and for worksheet 2B you can use GLM net. You need not build one from scan just import the

18
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:08,280
life duties. You can use any library you want. There is no compression on the syntax you can use

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:20,719
any libraries. Which question the OLS assumptions? For OLS assumptions you can do like three. You can

20
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:28,180
check if the residuals are residuals for the normal distribution. You can check with homosadacity

21
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,560
and you can check for the linear relationship. You can do three that is enough.

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:42,539
Let us answer your question. If you did as a map down it will be better and professional. If it is

23
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:53,080
code then use the code. Both graphs and write ups because try to add your analysis as much as possible

24
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:01,560
not only code. So, add comments or map down whatever you are plotting. Ignase you can unmute and

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,740
pause the question.

26
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:23,319
So, you can add a map down cell and answer in that cell after each question.

27
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:35,770
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I do. The histogram of residuals is in the normal distribution. But do

28
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:53,409
add like a text. I will just do not add the code. I do not write the code for plotting

29
00:03:53,409 --> 00:04:00,129
whatever you want to write the text or analysis and code cells when you want to execute the code.

30
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,870
Add there any more questions or mission random. There will be another T.S. session

31
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,949
profile days before the deadline. So, you guys should the portion should be covered by then.

32
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,769
So, you guys should be able to solve that. About the hackathon we will let you know. So,

33
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,250
you guys have any more questions. Okay. We lent them. Thank you for joining us.

34
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,149
If any of you have missed the first part of this session, you'll make the recording available.

35
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,649
You guys can catch up with that. Thank you.
