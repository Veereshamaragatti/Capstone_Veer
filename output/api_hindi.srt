Welcome to Sitsisik in Whiteboard and today lesson stand what is an API?

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,060
So, an API stands for application programming interface and is a set of rules that protocols that

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,199
defines how two software programs or systems can communicate with each other. It acts as an

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,160
intermediary between the two systems along them to exchange data and functionality. For example,

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,039
an API might allow a mobile app to access data from a database or it might allow a website to access

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,500
the functionality of a third party service like a payment processor.

7
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,039
APIs are an important part of modern software development as they enable different software programs

8
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,359
and systems to work together and share data and functionality. They are used in a wide range of

9
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,920
applications including web development, mobile development and data analysis.
